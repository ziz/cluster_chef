#this is not fun

# sudo apt-get install r-base
# sudo gem install rsruby -- --with-R-dir=/usr/share/R --with-R-lib=/usr/lib/R --with-R-include=/usr/share/R/include
# export R_HOME=/usr/lib/R

# Once R is installed you'll want to install some essential packages like VGAM and ggplot, ie. install.packages('VGAM')
